# Stack of Plates

Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. 
Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some treshold.
Implement a data strcuture SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be composed of several stacks and should create
a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to
a single stack.

Implement function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
